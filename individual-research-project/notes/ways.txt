A Comparative Analysis of Image Quality Assessment Metrics in Single-Image Super-Resolution using Residual Dense Networks and Generative Adversarial Networks

25 real-world images used in my project and questionnaire are taken by SONY ILCE-7RM3 camera (In short, called A7R3 or alpha7R3 and SONY ILCE-1 camera (In short, called A1 or alpha1). The lens utilised to take these images is FE 16-36mm F2.8GM; FE 100-400mm F4.5-5.6 OSS; FE 50mm F1.2 GM.

Experiments:
1. Pre-processing for downsampling images (5 methods)
2. RDN and RRDN for upsamling images (4 methods) (3 ways RDN + 1 way RRDN [GAN])
3. 5 * 4 = 20 (in total)
4. Objective methods: (full reference) PSNR, SSIM and MSE to rate the quality of 20 ways (Pre-processing + RDN/RRDN super-resolution methods)
5. NIMA (Main focus) (NIMA to test the original images) (3 different NIMA models)
6. Subjective methods: to rate the original images, and compare with NIMA (To compare the score produced by machine and the score produced by human visual system) (Under same original images)
7. Discuss possible ways to optimise NIMA (3 different NIMA models)
