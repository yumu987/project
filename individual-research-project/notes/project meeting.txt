subjective image quality assessment metric:
objective image quality assessment metric:

1. Find some newer data set
The original images have very high resolution nowadays.
This is what we have nowadays.
Use data set with higher resolution: that's what we did nowadays.

2. For the next meeting, write down a
create a small diagram for what you want to include in your results
a. what models you're going to test
b. what data sets
c. what resolution
d. what quality metrics
e. if we're testing a 2 step approach, we have to decide what will be the first level, the first level of interpolation, normally it is bicubic.
You might have choice, to do the first step.
Minimising a certain loss function.
Optimising a certain quality metric

Goal: evaluate the performance of 3 different models. Then you will know what exactly experiments you want to do.

Do counterpart experiments.

Compare how they perform. What about others?

Want to introduce a new image quality metric in the procedure. You optimise and do test.

What you need to write now: think about what the results after will look like.

If you know what the results after will look like then you know what experiments you need to do.
